With kubeadm we can create a k8s cluster from scratch.

- First install kubeadm
  - Install the components on 3 VMs with below instructions
  - https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/
- Bootstrapping the cluster
  - Set one of the nodes as master by running `kubeadm init`. It brings up all the components required to run in the master
  - Follow instructions on the console to complete the setup
  - You will also see the command for the worknode to join the master node
  - Run the join command on the worker nodes
  - Run `systemctl restart kubelet` on the worker nodes
  - Install the add-on on master node to create network between worker nodes. Run command given here https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kubernetes/kube-addon/#-installation on the master node.
  - Run `kubectl get nodes` on master node and verify that the status is Ready.
