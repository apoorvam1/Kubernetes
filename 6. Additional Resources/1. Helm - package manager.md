Helm is package manager. With helm you can install packages on the cluster that brings up the application present in the package. 

Packages that are installed with helm are called Charts. Helm Repo: https://github.com/helm/helm. List of avaialable charts: https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0


Helm has 2 components
- Helm: A client that will be installed on local
- Tiller: A server, it gets installed inside the cluster.

There are a  lot of Helm charts that you can use to bring up the application in the cluster. 

### install helm
Run command `brew install helm`

- Repo: https://github.com/helm/charts
- All stable charts can be found here: https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable

### Components of helm chart
- Basic skeleton of a chart has `Chart.yaml`, `README`, `values.yaml` and `templates` folder. 
- templates folder will have all required k8s manifests like `deployment.yaml`,  `pvc.yaml`, `secrets.yaml`, `svc.yaml` etc. 
- When we use helm install all the objects mentioned in the templates will be deployed.
- If you check any yaml file in `templates` you can see that it's actually a template for that kind. ex: https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/lamp/templates/secret.yaml
- During installation, Tiller substitutes the values in those templates. All values will be defined in `values.yaml`
