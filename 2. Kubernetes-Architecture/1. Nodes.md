In Kubernetes cluster machines there are 2 type of machines
1. Head Node: has 4 type of processes
  - API Server
  - Scheduler: schedule the containers
  - Controller Manager: makes sure the state of the system is what it should be
  - Etcd: Storage to store the state of the systemm
  - Optionally: kubelet, docker
2. Worker Node
  - kubelet: kubernetes agent that runs on all worker nodes. It talks to API server and then talks to docker daemon to manage the docker container running on the node.
  - kube-proxy: Not really a proxy, system to manage ip table in the node
  - docker
